# Installation

:::{important}
The following commands will install *sequence* into your current environment. Although
not necessary, we **highly recommend** you install sequence into its own
{ref}`virtual environment <virtual_environments>`.
:::

<!-- start-install-release -->

In order to use *sequence* you will first need Python. While not
necessary, we recommend using the
[Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
as it provides a large number of third-party packages useful for
scientific computing.

## Basic Install

If you would like to use *Sequence*, but not modify the code, you can follow
the basic installation instructions and install a pre-built version.

## Developer Install

If you will be modifying code or contributing new code to *sequence*, you will first
need to get *Sequence*'s source code and then install *sequence* from that code.
